			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What will Search Engine Optimization look like in 2015? It&#8217;s become something of a tradition for SEO professionals to come up with their predictions at the end of each year: are we looking at a full-scale revolution or a few minor changes? Here&#8217;s what I think we&#8217;re in for in 2015&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19074" title="Blog-Post-SEO2015" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/12/Blog-Post-SEO2015.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="305" /></p>
<p><span id="more-19063"></span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #009345;">SEO will be (almost) the same in 2015</span></h4>
<p>Panda, Penguin, Hummingbird, Caffeine &#8230; Although Google is always telling us about its latest algorithm updates, SEO in general remains largely the same, with, of course, a few developments here and there. As the saying goes, if the algorithm ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it.</p>
<p><strong>As far as I can see, Google Search is striving to achieve two goals:</strong></p>
<ul style="padding: 0 0 0 30px;">
<li>To make its users happy by displaying high-quality, relevant results</li>
<li>To increase revenue from these search results through AdWords</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Google&#8217;s aim is not to provide you with free traffic</strong>, generating more free traffic is the purpose of SEO. I think it&#8217;s vital to make this distinction.</p>
<p><strong>Since 1998, Google&#8217;s algorithm &#8216;recipe&#8217; has used more or less the same ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul style="padding: 0 0 0 30px;">
<li>Relevance (how well your website corresponds to the search query)</li>
<li>Popularity (how many links direct towards your site)</li>
</ul>
<p>Given <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#all-search_engine-ww-monthly-201310-201410" target="_blank">Google&#8217;s worldwide monopoly over the market</a>, this strategy is clearly working, so I see no reason why Google would decide to rethink its algorithm.</p>
<p>So, my prediction for 2015 is that SEO will continue to develop along much the same lines (an opinion shared by <a href="http://moz.com/rand/google-seo-dont-actually-change-much/" target="_blank">Rand Fishkin, founder of Moz</a> on his blog.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #009345;">So, how will SEO develop exactly?</span></h4>
<p>Here at <a href="http://www.prestashop.com" target="_blank">PrestaShop</a>, we are committed to discussing e-commerce with e-merchants. Since SEO is an essential growth tool for small stores, I have put together my list of predictions for the future of e-commerce SEO.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #009345;">2015 will be all about mobile</span></h4>
<p>Back in early 2014, <a href="http://searchengineland.com/matt-cutts-mobile-queries-may-surpass-pc-year-186816" target="_blank">Matt Cutts</a> had already predicted that numbers of search requests sent from mobile devices would surpass those of PCs.</p>
<p>Likewise in the UK, <a href="https://www.internetretailer.com/2014/09/02/mobile-visitors-overtake-desktop-visitors-rthe-uk" target="_blank">Internet Retailer announced in September</a>, that mobile and tablet traffic to its retail site had overtaken that of PCs.</p>
<p>Below you can see a comparison of global traffic from PCs, smartphones and tablets compiled by StatCounter.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop+mobile+tablet-comparison-ww-monthly-201311-201410" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-19064" title="graphe" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/12/graphe.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>If you play around a bit on the StatCounter website and filter the results by country, you will in fact see that mobile is already the dominant channel in certain markets. I&#8217;m especially thinking of <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop+mobile+tablet-comparison-IN-monthly-201311-201410" target="_blank">India here, where mobile is leagues ahead of the rest, accounting for 70% of total traffic</a>. But whatever your target location, the trend is catching.</p>
<p>You should also bear in mind that more and more people are <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/a-majority-uses-mobile-as-second-screen-2013-5" target="_blank">using their smartphones while watching TV</a>.</p>
<p>The mobile and tablet boom is well and truly underway, and to come back to SEO, Google – who is also seeing growth in mobile traffic – wants to satisfy its users by providing as many mobile-compatible hits as possible. That&#8217;s why Google favors online retailers with mobile sites, to the detriment of those who are still only desktop-ready.</p>
<p>In the US, Google already displays a site&#8217;s mobile compatibility right from the SERP (Search Engine Result Page):</p>
<div style="height: 445px;">
<p style="text-align: center; float: left; padding: 0 15px;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-17888" title="screen-search" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/12/screen-search-576x1024.png" alt="" width="250" height="442" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center; float: left;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-17889" title="screen-search2" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/12/screen-search2-576x1024.png" alt="" width="250" height="442" /></p>
</div>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.stonetemple.com/googles-gary-illyes-discusses-mobile-as-a-ranking-factor/" target="_blank">Gary Illyes</a>, in order to receive this little &#8216;mobile-friendly&#8217; badge of honor on results pages, all you need to do is take the Google Webmaster Mobile-Friendly Test. This tool will let you see whether your site is mobile-friendly and if it meets Google&#8217;s criteria:<br />
<a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/" target="_blank">Take the mobile test</a></p>
<p>If you want to delve even deeper, I recommend reading <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JohnMueller/posts/WT5YccbhkXi" target="_blank">this G+ blog post by John Mueller</a>, which does just that.</p>
<p><strong>My Mobile SEO recommendation for 2015</strong></p>
<p>You will need a mobile-friendly version of your online store. If you want to continue developing your SEO, you have two main options: using a responsive design template (whereby layout changes according to the viewing environment), or a dedicated mobile site, i.e. http://m.example.com.</p>
<ul style="padding: 0 0 0 30px;">
<li><a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/3-templates-prestashop?m=true&amp;responsive=1" target="_blank">All of PrestaShop&#8217;s responsive design templates</a></li>
<li><a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/mobile/8936-shopgate.html" target="_blank">The Shopgate solution for creating a dedicated mobile site</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Mobile SEO prediction</strong></p>
<p>I anticipate that in 2015, or latest 2016, 100% of all Google results matching queries made from a smartphone will be mobile-friendly. In other words <strong>you&#8217;ll no longer see desktop sites on your smartphone</strong>.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #009345;">An HTTP-secure year</span></h4>
<p>Google&#8217;s other main campaign for 2014 was to urge websites to switch over to HTTPS from HTTP. They even added it as a <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-starts-giving-ranking-boost-secure-httpsssl-sites-199446" target="_blank">ranking signal in their search algorithm</a>.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t get ahead of yourself by thinking this alone will get you on the first page of Google results! However, since every little bit helps, why not give it a try?<br />
<strong>My Security SEO recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Switch your online store to HTTPS in 2015.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #009345;">Back to basics</span></h4>
<p>So, here is why I mentioned SEO evolution&#8230; although SEO is undergoing constant change, the process of optimizing your website for Google searches remains largely the same:</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 18px;">To come first, you need to have the best content with the best links.</span></p>
<p><strong>Start by identifying keywords</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/find-the-right-seo-keywords-for-your-online-store/" target="_blank">Find the right SEO keywords for your online store</a></p>
<h4><span style="color: #009345;">Your New Year&#8217;s resolutions for SEO-friendly content</span></h4>
<p><a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/how-to-use-your-seo-keywords-to-structure-your-ecommerce-site/" target="_blank">Structure your online store for optimum SEO</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/content-marketing-for-ecommerce-technical-checklist-writing-process/" target="_blank">Then think about your Content Marketing strategy</a></p>
<p>You should also make sure the titles and descriptions you use on product and category pages are properly formulated to maximize SERP CTR and conversion.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #009345;">My Link Building recommendation for 2015</span></h4>
<p>Half the battle when creating a good SEO strategy is getting linking right. But that doesn&#8217;t just mean optimizing the tags used in your online store or writing a few blog posts; to increase your SEO in 2015, you will still need links, but they will have to be good quality.</p>
<p><strong>What Google is doing to e-commerce sites with poor links</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19067" title="matt-cutts-vs-netlinking" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/12/matt-cutts-vs-netlinking.gif" alt="" width="360" height="240" /></p>
<p>Google has declared all-out war on websites selling links, and has even reported them in its Webmaster Guidelines violations. From a legal standpoint, even though Google doesn&#8217;t make the law, it really does rule over the Internet, so I would recommend taking extreme precaution if you don&#8217;t want to get caught by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Penguin" target="_blank">PINGUIN</a>.</p>
<p><strong>In the meantime, here are a few Link Building tips for 2015</strong></p>
<ul style="padding: 0 0 0 30px;">
<li>Don&#8217;t construct your own link building if you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing.</li>
<li>Enlist the help of an SEO agency or professional.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t use (or stop using) link-selling sites.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t optimize by using keyword-rich anchor text such as my keyword.</li>
<li>Use unique anchors or ones that contain the name of your website, for example.</li>
<li>Think about consistency with websites that redirect to you or your online store.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re still in the habit of exchanging links with other websites, stop right now!</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t get led into believing that link building is just about inserting a few links into blog comments, forum posts or directories.</li>
<li>Remember that a good link is one that will bring in traffic.</li>
<li>Use links that direct to different pages of your website.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, know that it&#8217;s not true that you need to pay to have links. Remember that your product pages and your blog content can provide you with links just by being top quality.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you a small business with a local storefront thinking about selling online? Not sure if online shopping is a trend or the future? As an ecommerce software provider, we would (of course) say you definitely need an online shop. But just saying so isn’t enough.</p>
<p>Today we support our claim with our article titled, “From bricks to clicks: 5 reasons you need to sell online today.” We’re sharing the limitations of a traditional brick and mortar and showing you how an online shop complements your retail shop to help you get the best of both worlds.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19051" title="BRICK-AND-MORTAR .small" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/12/BRICK-AND-MORTAR-.small_.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="305" /><br />
<span id="more-19044"></span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #ae2b6d;">1. Your shop is not open 24/7.</span></h4>
<p>When is your current shop open? 8:00AM -7:00PM? What happens to customers who want to shop long after your shop has closed? Closing your shop is literally turning customers at your door, away.</p>
<p>Sure, you can keep your shop open longer. However, the overhead to do so is significantly more than creating an online shop &#8211; especially with PrestaShop’s free open source software. The best thing about online shops? They are open 24/7. By launching one, you easily extend your store hours.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #ae2b6d;">2. Some customers cannot physically go to your shop.</span></h4>
<p>Many business owners are familiar with this phrase: “location, location, location”. When running a retail shop, the success of your shop is due in large to its location. If it is not convenient for customers to get to your store, you can kiss them goodbye.</p>
<p>Opening an online shop allows everyone in the country, or even the world, to access your shop! Suddenly your shop’s location is no longer an issue. You are no longer limited to selling just to customers in your neighborhood.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #ae2b6d;">3. Shelf space is limited.</span></h4>
<p>Just as important as your retail shop’s location, is the amount of shelf space you have. As a retail shop owner, you know all too well that products need to be positioned and lit properly in your showroom. This limits the number of products you can display at a given time.</p>
<p>With your online shop, the number of products you can display is unlimited. Your challenge will be to make great product pages that are easy to navigate. Start with <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/diy-ecommerce-guide-to-gorgeous-product-photography/" target="_blank">gorgeous product images</a> then compliment them with <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/sell-more-online-8-tips-for-your-product-descriptions/" target="_blank">great product descriptions</a>. Then help customers navigate your shop with a <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/how-to-use-your-seo-keywords-to-structure-your-ecommerce-site/" target="_blank">keyword driven website structure</a>. With these 3 things in place, you are ready to expand your product selection beyond the shelf space of your retail shop.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #ae2b6d;">4. Profits are limited through one sales channel.</span></h4>
<p>Selling through a retail location is just one of the many channels you can use. Opting for just one channel limits your ability to increase profits because you are limiting your customer base. In short, by limiting customers you also limit your sales.</p>
<p>Grow your business and sell more by adding a new sales channel &#8211; an online shop. You will target a wider customer base, and sell a larger volume of products. This will put you in the position to negotiate better inventory rates from suppliers and increase profit margins for your business overall.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #ae2b6d;">5. Self-promotions appear untrustworthy.</span></h4>
<p>No matter how great the products you sell are, positive product reviews that come directly from you will always appear sales-y and fake. After all, no shop owner will ever speak badly about their product(s).</p>
<p>This is why having an online shop can benefit your retail shop. One of the greatest advantages of an online shop is the ability to leverage social proof. Customer reviews and testimonials build credibility in your products because this promotion comes from someone who doesn’t benefit from saying that the product is good.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #ae2b6d;">In a nutshell</span></h4>
<p>If you’re already have a retail shop, your online store simply becomes an extension of your current shop. Selling online will extend your shop’s reach, product selection and hours of operation. By doing so, you increase the number of potential customers, which can translate into additional sales.</p>
<p>Have we convinced you to open an online shop to expand your brick and mortar store? Start <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/en/download" target="_blank">selling online with PrestaShop’s</a> shopping cart software. Already selling both online and offline? Tell us which reason is your favorite in the comments below.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Online merchants are always looking for ways to improve their online shop. Because of this, many experts have researched and tested different design elements to optimize the effectiveness of websites. As researchers learn more about online shoppers, they share their results through infographics, blog articles and more.</p>
<p>With so many website elements you can test, where should you start? Today we’re helping you narrow it down by sharing 6 A/B tests for optimizing your online store.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19036" title="AB-test" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/12/AB-test.png" alt="AB testing" width="580" height="305" /></p>
<p><span id="more-19034"></span></p>
<p>A/B testing allows online merchants to display one of two versions of their website. By measuring each page’s effectiveness, merchants can determine which design is better at converting customers. But before you dive into these tests, it’s important to know your online store’s current performance. Collect baseline numbers for all the statistics you’d like to track before you start A/B testing these design elements.</p>
<h4 style="color: #0c59a8;">1. Homepage Design</h4>
<p><strong style="color: #214975;">Headings</strong> &#8211; If you currently have headings on your website, test the copy, its size or try removing it altogether.<br />
<strong style="color: #214975;">Slider or Carousel</strong> &#8211; Is your homepage slider an awesome converter or a boring distraction? VWO, an A/B testing company, believes <a href="https://vwo.com/blog/image-slider-alternatives/" target="_blank">image sliders are no longer effective</a>. They suggest the following: using a static image, removing the block or simply limiting the number of slides to two.</p>
<h4 style="color: #0c59a8;">2. <a style="color: #0c59a8; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/15-examples-of-cta-buttons-to-drive-conversions-for-online-stores/" target="_blank">Call to Action</a> or CTA</h4>
<p><strong style="color: #214975;">Color</strong> &#8211; Research has shown that humans naturally <a href="http://www.responsecapture.com/campaign-optimization/what-message-is-your-call-to-action-sending/" target="_blank">associate color to certain ideas and feelings</a>. Find out what feeling your CTA exhibits, then try different colors to see if they are better converters.</p>
<p><strong style="color: #214975;">Size</strong> &#8211; One thing is for sure, your CTA must be clearly visible. However, large CTAs may be distracting and take away from the overall page. A/B test to find the right fit for your website.</p>
<p><strong style="color: #214975;">Copy</strong> &#8211; Tempting copy should be used throughout your website, but most especially for CTA buttons. When writing copy, keep in mind works for discount retailers may not convert shoppers on luxury boutiques, so be sure it carries the right tone of voice to target your customer profile.</p>
<h4 style="color: #0c59a8;">3. Checkout: Five vs one page</h4>
<p>Experts disagree about the effectiveness of a 5 page checkout when compared to a one page checkout. Supporters of the 5 page checkout believe it’s what customers have come to expect. On the other hand, supporters of the one page checkout believe shortening the checkout process decreases shopping cart abandonment.</p>
<h4 style="color: #0c59a8;">4. <a style="color: #0c59a8; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/diy-ecommerce-guide-to-gorgeous-product-photography/" target="_blank">Product Images</a></h4>
<p>High resolution images that showcase the product are perfect for product pages. However, are they the most effective? Try each of these product image ideas to see how they convert.</p>
<p><strong style="color: #214975;">Background</strong> – Although white is the most commonly used color, try soft tones that goes well with your product. Adding a warm feel to the image may help lure customers in.</p>
<p><strong style="color: #214975;">Views</strong> – Which angle is your product currently photographed from? Try switching it up! Have you tried a bird’s eye view (from up top) or a side angle view?</p>
<p><strong style="color: #214975;">Model</strong> – Having models showcase your product can help it sell because customers get a feel of what the product will look like on a person. However, models can also distract customers from your product, decreasing your ability to make the sale. A/B test to see which option your customers prefer.</p>
<h4 style="color: #0c59a8;">5. Social Proof</h4>
<p>Does displaying your social media followers really help build trust in your company? Some shops benefit from displaying trust building elements like payment logos, social media buttons, and security badges. Other shops saw a lift in conversions once they were removed. Find out what works for you.</p>
<h4 style="color: #0c59a8;">6. Pricing and Promotions</h4>
<p>In our blog post titled, the <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/the-psychology-of-pricing-and-discounts-for-e-commerce/" target="_blank">Phycology of Pricing and Discounts for Ecommerce</a>, we suggest 4 different ideas of product pricing and promotions you can try. However, we must caution that A/B testing pricing and promotions can be risky because customers may believe you are unfairly pricing your products. With that said, we recommend working with a professional when running pricing and promotion tests.</p>
<h4 style="color: #0c59a8;">It’s your turn.</h4>
<p>Regardless of which A/B test you decide to run first, remember to test one thing at a time. If you’re testing the CTA button, modify the only the text or color but not both. Modifying multiple features will make your data hard to interpret.</p>
<hr align="left" size="2" width="20%" />
<p>Which of these A/B tests are you looking to run? Let us know in the comments below. If you’re already running tests, tell us about your findings. Not an online merchant yet?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Analysts widely expect this year’s Black Friday and Cyber Monday to break the record again. From Friday November 28 through Monday December 1, retailers should see double-digit increases in online sales over the same period last year. The giants in retail are well-positioned to take advantage of this surge in traffic and sales, but the small and nimble ecommerce merchants will not sit on the sidelines. In the time it takes to put up the Christmas tree, every e-retailer can get ready for the most important ecommerce days of the year. Here are just a few tips for this week.</p>
<p><img title="main" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/11/Blog1.png" alt="" width="584" height="306" /></p>
<h3><span id="more-19005"></span></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #2574a9;">1. Show your holiday spirit</span></h3>
<p>It wouldn’t be the holidays without glittering lights, boughs of holly and Rudolph’s red nose. Brick and mortar stores start their Christmas displays in early November. You don’t want to be the one house in the neighborhood with no holiday lights. Be sure to add a little sparkle to your online store. Even a simple Santa hat on the store logo or a bough of holly on the homepage banner says to visitors… this is a destination for holiday shopping! Be sure to announce your holiday promotions and consider dedicating a full landing page to your holiday offers. Now is also the time to really showcase your products with colorful photos. Help your customers see those terrific gift ideas in your online store.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #2574a9;">2. Deck the products</span></h3>
<p>Small, but important updates to the product catalog can make a big difference for holiday shoppers. A gift guide should be one of the first tools you put together as you prepare for the holiday rush. This will certainly help your customers to find the perfect gift for Mom, Dad and the whole family. Think about the products that will make the best gifts this holiday season and showcase them with holiday-inspired product descriptions. This will help your shoppers to see your products in a holiday context and make faster gift selections. For the most popular items in your catalog, be sure to suggest complementary gifts. In fact, bundled products encourage even more purchases by taking the guesswork out of gift giving so don’t hesitate to create gift baskets for those complimentary products.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #2574a9;">3. Oh Ship</span></h3>
<p>There’s nothing worse than being caught short-handed when you’re in the middle of the holiday rush. To prepare for increased shipments of your products, be sure to stock up on bestselling inventory, shipping materials and office supplies ahead of time. Look for ways to optimize your packing and shipping process this holiday season. For example, you can speed-up order processing by pre-packing your best-sellers. You can also encourage earlier holiday shipping by offering specials. Here are some shipping specials that work:<br />
• Free shipping on orders, over a certain value<br />
• Same day shipping<br />
• Flat-rate shipping<br />
• Free returns</p>
<p>Be sure to advertise these shipping specials throughout your website and social channels with eye-catching banners and coupon codes. Last, but not least… don’t forget to factor-in time for quality checks on those shipments. You don’t want customers remembering you for the incorrect or damaged gift they received just before the holidays!</p>
<h3><span style="color: #2574a9;">4. November is the new January</span></h3>
<p>Did you see an advertisement for Christmas deals in your local department store – in November? Yes, you did. Each year those holiday sales start earlier and earlier because, simply stated, they work so well. Here are some holiday promotions that will get your site visitors buying this holiday season.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #2574a9;">Doorbusters</span></strong></p>
<p>Doorbusters is a marketing strategy employed by brick-and-mortar stores. The strategy is to promote special offers for short periods of time. You can offer larger discounts earlier in the day and decrease the sale as the day progresses. For example, orders completed before 8:00AM receive a 30% discount, 8:01AM-10:00AM 25%, and after 10:00AM 20%. It’s an effective way to drive customers to your site early, before they have the chance to shop somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #2574a9;">Cross-selling and upselling</span></strong></p>
<p>Two classic marketing strategies, cross-selling and upselling will certainly help to boost sales. Cross-selling encourages customers to buy more products by suggesting complimentary, but non-competing items. For example, if your shop sells gourmet cheese, use a ‘customers also bought’ section to suggest the best bread to go with the cheese. Upselling persuades customers to spend more money by adding features to the same product. Using the same cheese example, you can upsell the gift basket which includes a nice collection of food and wine.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #2574a9;">Flash sales</span></strong></p>
<p>Flash sales is a promotional tactic that can be very effective at the holidays. People will often comparison shop or wait until the last minute to choose gifts. If you offer a flash sale, where a set of products are promoted for a limited period of time and then withdrawn, this creates urgency and deadlines. It will encourage your customers to make their purchasing decisions quickly instead of leaving the site with unpurchased products in a shopping cart.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #2574a9;">5. Eggnog and email marketing</span></h3>
<p>Like a strong glass of eggnog, email marketing can be your friend and your foe. You want to stay connected to your customers this holiday season, but you don’t want them to get tired of seeing your logo in their inbox. Or worse yet, they unsubscribe from your updates entirely. So what’s the right answer? Think about how your business can be a partner in holiday happiness and not just another online store. Be part of the solution, and not part of the problem. Schedule email campaigns to coincide with your holiday promotions and major seasonal milestones, but avoid saturating your subscribers with pointless emails.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday are literally days away.  Many online merchants will process their largest number of orders during the weekend. If you’ve downloaded our <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/en/ecommerce-holiday-guide" target="_blank">ecommerce holiday guide</a>, you already have great ideas for promotions you can run.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="wp-image-18984 aligncenter" title="BP_Sale" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/11/BP_Sale.png" alt="" width="540" height="283" />Once you’ve set up your sales, getting the word out is just as important. Check out this quick guide to promoting Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales.</p>
<p><span id="more-18983"></span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ed2279;">1.</span> Homepage Slider or Banner</span></h2>
<p>The best place to tell customers about sales is on your homepage. Both visitors looking for sales and those simply browsing your shop will be greeted with your sale announcement. Ensure the slider or banner is linked to your sale products, so customers can start shopping immediately.</p>
<p>BACK OFFICE &gt; MODULES &gt; IMAGE SLIDER FOR YOUR HOMEPAGE &gt; CONFIGURE</p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="color: #ed2279;">2.</span> Send out an email blast</strong></span></h2>
<p>Delivering your sale directly into your customer’s inbox will put your sale directly within their reach. Entice your customer to open your email with a tempting subject line.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that more and more customers are opening emails on mobile devices. Be sure your emails can easily be read on smaller screens and that links open on the mobile version of your website, if your website isn’t responsive. Start promoting your sales with the <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/advertising-marketing-newsletter-modules/4932-newsletter-statistics.html" target="_blank">Newsletter and Statistics Module by PrestaShop</a>.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: inherit;" dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="color: #ed2279;">3.</span> Social Media is your Best Friend</strong></span></h2>
<p style="font-weight: inherit;" dir="ltr">Connect with customers through their favorite social media channel. Keep in mind that many other companies may also be offering their Black Friday / Cyber Monday deals, so ensure your ads contain:</p>
<ol style="font-weight: inherit;">
<li>Enticing deals</li>
<li>Targeted hashtags, specifically: #blackfriday #cybermonday #sale</li>
<li>Images (promoting products or holiday themed)</li>
</ol>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ed2279;">4.</span> List your Sale</span></h2>
<p>Once you’ve notified your <em>current</em> customers about your sale, it’s time to reach out to <em>potential</em> customers. List your sale on coupon sites like <a href="http://www.retailmenot.com/" target="_blank">RetailMeNot </a>or on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/coupons/" target="_blank">Coupon Forums</a> to gain more visibility with online shoppers. Everyone is looking to save money and start their holiday shopping. Make your sale as easy to find as possible.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ed2279;">5.</span> Purchase Ads</span></h2>
<p>If your budget allows, purchase advertising. Running ads during the holiday season may not be cheap but they give you the best chance at gaining even visibility among holiday shoppers. In this day and age, you’re not limited to search engine ads. Many social media platforms offer business accounts and the ability to purchase ads. Although these advertising channels are not traditional, they have a large reach. Try <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/ads/" target="_blank">Facebook </a>and <a href="https://support.twitter.com/groups/58-advertising/topics/242-welcome-to-twitter-ads/articles/20170393-how-twitter-ads-can-help-your-business" target="_blank">Twitter Ads</a> or even <a href="https://business.pinterest.com/en/promoted-pins" target="_blank">Promoted Pins on Pinterest</a>.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Have you ever visited an online store that looks like it accidently launched in the middle of construction? For many merchants, it’s no accident. New storeowners may sometimes be unaware of everything that should be tested before their store goes &#8230; <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/4-tests-to-run-before-launching-your-ecommerce-site/" rel="nofollow" class="more-link">Read more<span class="meta-nav"></span></a>]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-18948" title="check-list4" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/11/check-list4-1024x537.png" alt="header" width="584" height="306" />Have you ever visited an online store that looks like it accidently launched in the middle of construction? For many merchants, it’s no accident. New storeowners may sometimes be unaware of everything that should be tested before their store goes live.</p>
<p>From device compatibility to creating user scenarios, this article covers all of the essential tests to guarantee a successful launch. Once you finish reading, you’ll know how to effectively switch from “Pardon our dust” to “Open for business!”<span id="more-18946"></span></p>
<h4 style="color: #5c9435;">1. COMPATIBILITY &amp; RESPONSIVENESS</h4>
<p>The first thing to check on any website before launching is its compatibility and responsiveness, to ensure customers will be able to browse the store with every program and on every device available to them.</p>
<p>- <strong>Browser Compatibility</strong>: a browser compatibility test, such as the one available at <a href="https://crossbrowsertesting.com/" target="_blank">CrossBrowserTesting</a>, will check if your site is compatible on all of these browsers: Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Safari.<br />
- <strong>Website Responsiveness</strong>: a responsiveness test, like the one offered at <a href="http://responsivetest.net/" target="_blank">ResponsiveTest</a>, will display your website on screen sizes of the most popular desktops, tablets and phones to ensure your website displays beautifully on all of them.</p>
<h4 style="color: #5c9435;">2. CONTENT</h4>
<p>Next, double, triple and quadruple check your site’s content. And by content, I mean anything that visitors can see, read and hear. Confusing or unprofessional site content could affect your store’s credibility and negatively impact your sales, so make sure to review:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15px;"><br />
- Spelling and grammar errors<br />
- Formatting and homogeneity of the paragraphs, lists, and headings<br />
- Company contact information<br />
- Image sizes, positions, and usefulness<br />
- Product information, prices, descriptions, images, sizes available, etc.<br />
</span></p>
<h4 style="color: #5c9435;">3. FUNCTIONALITY</h4>
<p>Because your store is an interactive experience, it is not enough to just look at your pages to test if they are spot-on, you must interact with them and play with different scenarios. Here is a list of situations to double check to make sure the basic functionalities are working properly:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15px;"><br />
- Click on every link, button, image or text to make sure it takes you to the right page.<br />
- Check that external links, such as social media links, open on a separate tab or window.<br />
- Create test customer accounts.<br />
- Place test orders using all the payment methods you have available.<br />
- Delete the test orders once you are ready to launch.<br />
- If you have a Multilanguage store, test the different languages.<br />
- If you sell internationally, test the different currencies.<br />
</span></p>
<h4 style="color: #5c9435;">4. USER EXPERIENCE (BONUS!)</h4>
<p>An extra step to test before your online store’s successful launch is user experience, or in other words, ensuring that the journey within your website flows correctly. There are three levels at which you can test user experience. Run these tests every time you make a significant change on your website.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Test it yourself.</strong> Imagine that you are a customer that first visits the store. Ask yourself questions. Create situations to test user experiences such as finding relevant information, purchasing or searching for a specific product.</li>
<li><strong>Have your friends test it.</strong> Watch them navigate your site and ask them to execute certain actions or find specific pieces of information. Try to capture moments in which they get stuck and why they do so. Sometimes, even a simple modification in content, like a clearer call to action, can help solve these “stuck moments” and significantly improve your user experience.</li>
<li><strong>Have a professional service test it.</strong> User testing through websites such as <a href="http://www.usertesting.com/" target="_blank">UserTesting.com</a> are a great investment. The concept of their test is the same as the one above, but the difference is that your website will be tested by many different participants. This will help you confirm that your concept and messages are easily understandable throughout the user journey on your online Store.</li>
</ol>
<h4 style="color: #5c9435;">5. THE LAUNCH</h4>
<p>That’s it &#8211; you are now ready to launch! PrestaShop users, can activate your Online Store from your back-office, under the “Preferences / Maintenance” page, and setting the “Enable Shop” option to YES. Congratulations! Your store is officially open for business.</p>

<p>Hello PrestaShop Community,</p>
<p>An industry-wide security issue with SSL V3 has impacted PayPal. As a reminder, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide communication security over the internet. This specific SSL V3 issue is known in the industry as <a href="https://www.openssl.org/~bodo/ssl-poodle.pdf" target="_blank">POODLE</a>.</p>
<p>As a result, the PayPal Europe module for PrestaShop will need to be updated before December 3, 2014. We believe this update will only take you a few minutes and we encourage you to make the update as soon as possible.</p>
<p><span id="more-18923"></span></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If you have not edited your module files</span></em></p>
<p>Go to the modules section of the back office of your store and update the module with the automatic tool. <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/download/pdf/PrestaShop_POODLE_EN.pdf" target="_blank">See the tutorial here</a>.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If you have edited your module files</span></em></p>
<p>Please follow<a href="http://www.prestashop.com/download/pdf/PayPal_SSL_to_TLS.pdf" target="_blank"> our documentation</a> to make the update. This will only take a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>PayPal is providing regular updates to their community on <a href="https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/PayPal-Forward/UPDATE-PayPal-Response-to-SSL-v3-Vulnerability-aka-POODLE/ba-p/902239" target="_blank">their blog</a>.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-18892" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/11/google-analytics-ecommerce-1-1024x537.png" alt="" width="584" height="306" /></p>
<p>To begin with, let’s assume that you have been running your eCommerce site for a while and have the most basic eCommerce metrics tracking set up in your Google Analytics account like:</p>
<ol>
<ul>
<li>Transactions</li>
<li>Transaction Revenue</li>
<li>Transaction Shipping</li>
<li>Transaction Tax</li>
<li>Item Quantity</li>
<li>Unique Purchases</li>
<li>Item Revenue</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p>This post aims to cover 10 complementary but essential metrics that should be tracked in Google Analytics for deeper insight into performance and users’ flow through the conversion funnel to enable you view your online retail business from a different angle. <span id="more-18891"></span>They are:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #444444;"><a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/10-essential-ecommerce-metrics-for-google-analytics/#Buy-to-Detail-Rate"><span style="color: #333333;">Buy-to-Detail Rate</span></a></span></li>

<li><span style="color: #444444;"><a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/10-essential-ecommerce-metrics-for-google-analytics/#Revenue-Per-Session"><span style="color: #333333;">Revenue Per Session</span></a></span></li>
</ol>
<p>Some of these metrics can be tracked with the newly introduced <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/enhanced-ecommerce" target="_blank">Enhanced eCommerce </a>tracking, whilst the others can be found on tables and by setting up custom events. Let’s have a look at each metric in some more detail.<br />
<a name="Buy-to-Detail-Rate"></a></p>
<h4><span style="color: #f7981d;"><strong>1. Buy-to-Detail Rate</strong></span></h4>
<p>This is derived as unique purchases divided by views of product detail pages (Enhanced Ecommerce). It can be found under:<br />
<strong>Ecommerce -&gt; Product Performance report</strong><br />
<img class="size-full wp-image-18893 alignnone" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/11/Metrics-for-Google-Analytics-1.png" alt="" width="580" height="358" /><br />
This metric can help you answer the following question:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">• For what products users are more likely to convert/purchase after looking at the product details?</p>
<p><a name="Internal-Promotion-Clicks-and-Views"></a></p>
<h4><span style="color: #f7981d;"><strong>2. Internal Promotion Clicks and Views.</strong></span></h4>
<p>This is an essential metric to effectively track and decide whether to run internal promotions in your store and would like to see:</p>
<ol>
<ul>
<li>The most viewed promotions</li>
<li>The most clicked promotions</li>
<li>The Click-through-rate (CTR) of each promotion (Internal Promotion CTR)</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p>These set of metrics are located under:<br />
<strong>Ecommerce-&gt;Marketing-&gt;Internal Promotion:</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18894" title="Metrics for Google Analytics 2" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/11/Metrics-for-Google-Analytics-2.png" alt="" width="580" height="182" /><br />
<a name="Product-Adds-To-Cart"></a></p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #f7981d;">3. Product Adds To Cart</span></strong></h4>
<p>This is a must-have metric as it shows the number of times shoppers’ added products to their shopping carts. It could be tracked either as part of enhanced ecommerce tracking or by setting up the event tracking associated with users’ clicks on add-to-cart buttons.</p>
<p>When using enhanced ecommerce tracking this metric is available under:<br />
<strong>Ecommerce-&gt;Shopping Analysis-&gt;Product List Performance</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18895" title="Metrics for Google Analytics 3" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/11/Metrics-for-Google-Analytics-3.png" alt="" width="580" height="246" /></p>
<p>Having this metric in place provides you with the ability to analyze not only how many times products are added to cart but also why some products have higher conversion to purchase rates than the others.<br />
<a name="Product-Removes-From-Cart"></a></p>
<h4><span style="color: #f7981d;"><strong>4. Product Removes From Cart</strong></span></h4>
<p>This metric shows the number of times products have been removed from shopping carts. It can be tracked as part of Enhanced Ecommerce Tracking or can be set up as an event in event tracking that specifically tracks product removals from cart. Be sure to look out for products that are added to cart and then removed more often than others.</p>
<p>Track ‘<strong>Average</strong> <strong>Removes from Cart Rate’</strong>, which equals<br />
Total Removes from Cart / Adds to Cart.<br />
<a name="Product-Checkouts"></a></p>
<h4><span style="color: #f7981d;"><strong>5. Product Checkouts</strong></span></h4>
<p>Similar to product adds-to-cart, Product Checkouts show the number of times products were included at checkout. Product Checkout Tracking can be set up with Enhanced Ecommerce Tracking or with Event Tracking of clicks on the ‘Proceed to Checkout’ Button.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18896" title="Metrics for Google Analytics 4" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/11/Metrics-for-Google-Analytics-4.png" alt="" width="580" height="225" /></p>
<p>Important note is that: Products that proceed to checkout but unsuccessful orders should be further analyzed.<br />
<a name="Cost-Per-Acquisition-CPA"></a></p>
<h4><span style="color: #f7981d;"><strong>6. Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)</strong></span></h4>
<p>This is an essential metric that should be calculated and measured from two perspectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>What CPA can you afford, that will at the same time allow your business stay afloat?</li>
<li>What is your actual CPA after media traffic costs?</li>
</ol>
<p>Look at both figures and compare against each other:<br />
<strong>Planned CPA for Each Media Channel vs. Actual Spent CPA</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18897" title="Metrics for Google Analytics 5" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/11/Metrics-for-Google-Analytics-5.png" alt="" width="580" height="157" /><br />
<a name="Product-Refunds"></a></p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #f7981d;">7. Product Refunds</span></strong></h4>
<p>Available as part of Enhanced Ecommerce Tracking, this metric shows the number of times refunds were issued. Keep an eye on the <strong>Ecommerce-&gt;Product Performance</strong> report to spot products that have a high <strong>refund-to-purchase rate</strong> (which can be calculated as, total value of product refunds divided by product revenue).</p>
<p><a name="Customer-Lifetime-Value"></a></p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #f7981d;">8. Customer Lifetime Value</span></strong></h4>
<p>This specific metric is not readily available in any report, however it is very useful and meaningful as it shows the value of repeat customers and how much they bring into your business. Create the following Advanced Segment to view users that have made more than 1 purchase on your site:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18898" title="Metrics for Google Analytics 6" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/11/Metrics-for-Google-Analytics-6.png" alt="" width="580" height="260" /></p>
<p>By looking at the revenue totals from the ‘repeat customer segment’ in Analytics, you will be able to answer the question:</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<ul>
<li>How much can you afford to pay for a planned acquisition (your planned CPA), knowing you can make up the money over the next ‘X’ months if a first time customer further converts to a repeat customer?</li>
</ul>
</ol>
</ol>
<p><a name="Repeat-Purchase-Rate"></a></p>
<h4><span style="color: #f7981d;"><strong>9. Repeat Purchase Rate</strong></span></h4>
<p>This metric relates to CLF (Customer Lifetime Value) metric above and is calculated as purchases from repeat customer divided by all purchases on the site for a given date range. It simply allows more ‘bites at the apple’ from media planning perspective.<br />
<a name="Revenue-Per-Session"></a></p>
<h4><span style="color: #f7981d;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">10. Revenue Per Session</span></span></h4>
<p>This is a must-have metric to measure and keep track of, as it enables you properly identify and set your store’s CPA (Cost-Per-Acquisition) and CPC (Cost-Per-Click) when launching CPC/CPA based traffic acquisition campaigns.</p>
<p>As an example: if you have 1,000 sessions (previously known as visits) to your web site and that generate $10,000 in revenue, then</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Revenue Per Session = $10,000/1,000 = $10</strong></p>
<p>With that mind, and knowing that your profit margin was as an example: 20%, you may be willing to pay up to $2 per session (or click).</p>
<h4><span style="color: #f7981d;"><strong>Rounding Up</strong></span></h4>
<p>Although more data is typically always better than less, an overwhelming amount of data can frustrate and confuse even the most seasoned analysts. Aligning your focus on specific performance metrics is your only chance at extrapolating the most relevant pieces of information that really matter and drive business value.</p>
